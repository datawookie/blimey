#' ## Caveats
#'
#' The NetworkLinks dataset contains a geographic representation of the Network
#' Model at track level ELR  TRID track centre line. This model is constructed
#' of individual links that form the national network. The track level model is
#' represented as polyline. The baseline data for this layer was originally
#' created by the Corporate Network Model CNM in 2005. This was then updated
#' with new survey data from the Geospatial Model Stabilisation Project GMS.
#' Where GMS updates have been undertaken the track model has a positional
#' accuracy  0.5 meters x and y. Since the GMS project finished in early 2014
#' the data is being checked against GEOGIS, as part of the data improvement
#' process and where necessary updates are taking place. Since late 2017 this
#' updating process has now become part of managing INM and the Network Model
#' and INM are one of the same.
