The NetworkLinks dataset contains a geographic representation of the Network Model at track level ELR  TRID track centre line. This model is constructed of individual links that form the national network. The track level model is represented as polyline. The baseline data for this layer was originally created by the Corporate Network Model CNM in 2005. This was then updated with new survey data from the Geospatial Model Stabilisation Project GMS. Where GMS updates have been undertaken the track model has a positional accuracy  0.5 meters x and y. Since the GMS project finished in early 2014 the data is being checked against GEOGIS, as part of the data improvement process and where necessary updates are taking place. Since late 2017 this updating process has now become part of managing INM and the Network Model and INM are one of the same.
